RetroGameMachine
================

collection of retro games with a interactive menu to play them.

This allows you to select what console you want to use
and then lists the roms/games with a selection for what
one you want to play.

mainly for use with cli based emulators to make it easier
but it has a few gui based, but interactive menu loads the roms
the same way (skipping the need to file > load > rom)

BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD !
=====================

you need the dependency list :)

-  i will update this after i finished a script
-  so dont download yet unless you want to do it manually

HOW TO INSTALL
=====================

sudo mkdir /media/Games
sudo chmod 777 /media/Games
git clone git://github.com/justsueme/RetroGameMachine.git /media/Games
cd /media/Games
sudo ./INSTALL

=================

You DONT need root to play games or to run the menu.
Root is used to install only

the reason i thought /media/Games was the best place to keep
this, was 1) its out of the way, not adding clutter to your home folder  2) in case you want a whole hdd for retro games you can mount it at 
/media/Games before you grab the git.  3) because i wanted to :)
